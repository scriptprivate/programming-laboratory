**Questions:** 
1. Implement a program that takes as input a number (1-7) corresponding to one of the days of the week and prints the name of the corresponding day on the screen (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). If the number read is not in the range 1-7, print: "Invalid day number". The program should continue running until the user enters the number 0. (Use a test at the beginning).

2. Refactor the program from Question 1, using a loop structure with a test at the end.

3. Write a program that reads a positive integer number F and calculates its factorial.

4. Implement a program to solve the following problem: José is 150 centimeters tall and grows 2 centimeters per year. Pedro is 110 centimeters tall and grows 3 centimeters per year. In how many years will Pedro be taller than José?

5. Create a program that receives a value n from the keyboard and determines the largest and smallest term provided. The program should terminate when the user enters zero.

6. Write a program that turns the computer into an electronic ballot box for a presidential election in a certain country, where the candidates 5-Paulo and 7-Renata are running. Each vote must be given by the candidate's number, with the option of voting 0 for a blank vote. Any vote other than those mentioned is considered null; in any situation, the voter must be asked to confirm their vote. At the end of the election, the program should output a report containing the voting percentages for each candidate, blank votes, null votes, and the elected candidate. Note: The code to finalize the ballot (voting) is the user entering a negative number.

7. For division between two numbers to be possible, the divisor cannot be zero. Write a program to read 2 values and print the result of dividing the first by the second. Note: The program should validate the second value read (which should not be zero). While a null value is provided, the input should be repeated.

8. A store sells its products with an initial payment plus two installments, where the initial payment is greater than or equal to the two installments, and these must be equal, integer, and as large as possible. For example, if the value of the merchandise is $270.00, the down payment and the two installments are $90.00 each; if the value of the merchandise is $302.75, the down payment is $102.75 and the two installments are $100.00 each. Write a program that receives the value of the merchandise and provides the value of the down payment and the two installments, according to the above rules.

9. The Fibonacci series is formed by the following sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. Write an algorithm that generates the Fibonacci series up to the twentieth term.

10. Develop a program that presents the squares of integer multiples of 4 within the range of 15 to 90.

11. Redo question 10, considering that the limits of the range (A and B) are provided by the user. The program should work for both A > B and B > A.

12. Develop a program that shows the results of the multiplication table of any integer number, presented in its traditional form.

13. Create a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers within the specified range A,B specified by the user. The program should work for both A > B and B > A.

14. Create a program that presents the quantity of numbers divisible by 3 within the specified range A,B specified by the user. The program should work for both A > B and B > A.

15. Develop a program that presents the results of the powers of the base value 3, raised to an exponent ranging from 0 to 7.

16. Write a program that presents the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 belonging to the interval [0,100] and the sum of all numbers divisible by 5 belonging to the interval ]100,200]. Note: Use only one loop.

17. Develop a program that presents the conversion values from Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees, in increments of 10 degrees, starting from ten Celsius degrees and ending at one hundred Celsius degrees. The program should display the values of both temperatures. Note: Research the conversion formula.

18. Write a program that calculates and presents the sum of the number of wheat grains that can be obtained on a chessboard, following the following rule: place one grain of wheat on the first square and on the following squares double the grains from the previous square. That is, on the first square, one grain is placed, on the second square, two grains (having at this point three grains), on the third square, four grains (having at this point seven grains), on the fourth square, eight grains (having fifteen grains), until reaching the sixty-fourth square.

19. Develop a program that presents the arithmetic mean of the integer numbers existing between a range specified by the user.

20. Build a program that presents as a result the factorial of odd values ​​within the range of numbers from 1 to 10.

21. A palindrome is a number, or textual phrase, that can be read the same way from left to right and vice versa. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554, and 11611. Write a program that reads a five-digit integer and determines whether it is a palindrome or not. [Tip: use division and modulo operators to separate the number into its individual digits.]

22. Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints how many digits in the integer are the digit 7.

23. Write a program that shows the difference between pre-incrementing and post-incrementing using the operator -.

24. A right triangle can have sides that are integer values. The set of three integer values for the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple. These three sides need to satisfy the relationship that the sum of the square of two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Find all Pythagorean triples not exceeding 500 for leg1, leg2, and hypotenuse. This is an example of brute force computation. This is not aesthetically appealing to many people. But there are many reasons for these techniques to be important. As you will discover later in the Computer Science Course, there are many interesting problems for which there is no known algorithmic technique beyond simple brute force.

25. Calculate the value of π from the infinite series 
π = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + ...
Print a table showing the value of π approximated by one term of this series, and then by two terms, three terms, and so on.

26. Write a program that prints a table of binary, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents of decimal numbers in the range from 1 to 256.

27. Write a program that receives several integer numbers (in a loop structure) and presents the product of the largest and smallest number presented. (Note: Do not use arrays.) The exit condition of the loop is the user entering a negative and even number.

28. Write a program that receives two numerical values X and Y (unsigned char) and hides all the bits of X in each of the least significant bits of the 4 elements immediately before and after Y. (Note: Do not use values for Y less than 5).
