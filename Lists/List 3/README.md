**Questions:**
1. Write a C program that reads an array of 15 float elements and displays the sum of the smallest and largest element of the provided array.
2. Write a C program that reads a string and a character from the user and informs whether the input string contains the provided character.
3. Write a C program that reads a string from the user and informs the number of characters in the provided string. Do not use the strlen() function.
4. Write a C program that reads two strings from the user and informs whether they are equal. Provide one version using the strcmp() function and another without.
5. Write a C program that concatenates two strings received from the user. Provide one version using the strcat() function and another without.
6. Write a C program that reads a string from the user and displays it in reverse order.
7. Write a C program that generates an array with 3 pseudo-random integers in the range [0, 19] and displays their arithmetic and geometric mean.
8. Write a C program that generates an array with 100 pseudo-random integers in the range defined by the user and displays this array in sorted (ascending) order. Provide one version using the selection sort method and another using the bubble sort method.
9. Write a program that reads a two-dimensional matrix from the user, with dimensions 3x3, and displays the elements of the main diagonal.
10. Write a program that generates a two-dimensional matrix with random elements and receives an integer value x from the user. The program should inform how many times x appears in the generated matrix.

In all programs, use `#define` for the size of the array/matrix.
